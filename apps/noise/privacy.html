        <h1>Privacy Policy – Calm dB</h1>
        <p class="muted">
          Last updated: <strong>2026-01-19</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy explains how the <strong>Calm dB</strong> mobile application
          (“<strong>Calm dB</strong>”, “<strong>the App</strong>”) developed by
          <strong>Indie Apps Lab</strong> (“<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”,
          “<strong>our</strong>”) handles your information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Calm dB is a sound level meter. It uses the microphone on your device to measure
          sound levels in decibels (dB) and shows the result on screen. The App is designed
          to be as privacy-friendly as possible and to minimise the data we process.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy applies to the Calm dB mobile application and describes how it
          handles data on your device.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Key Points at a Glance</h2>
        <p>
          This short summary explains Calm dB’s overall approach to privacy and data:
        </p>
        <ul class="app-feature-list">
          <li><strong>No accounts or sign-in.</strong> You can use the App without creating an account.</li>
          <li><strong>No server collection of your measurements.</strong> We do not send your sound measurements or measurement history to our servers.</li>
          <li><strong>No audio recordings.</strong> Microphone input is processed in real time only and is not recorded or stored as sound files.</li>
          <li><strong>No ads.</strong> The App does not include advertising networks.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Limited diagnostics via Google Firebase.</strong> The App uses Firebase to understand crashes and improve stability.
            This may involve collecting technical diagnostic data (see section 7).
          </li>
          <li><strong>Data leaves your device only if you share it.</strong> Measurement data (for example CSV/JSON exports) leaves your device only when you actively export or share it through other apps or services.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Processed by Calm dB</h2>
        <p>
          Calm dB is designed to work primarily with data that never leaves your device.
          Below is an overview of what the App uses and how.
        </p>

        <h3>3.1 Audio Data (Microphone Input)</h3>
        <ul class="app-feature-list">
          <li>
            The App uses the microphone to access live audio input and calculate sound level
            in decibels (dB).
          </li>
          <li>
            The audio signal is processed <strong>only in memory on your device</strong>
            to calculate the noise level.
          </li>
          <li>
            The App <strong>does not record, store or transmit</strong> the raw audio
            as sound files.
          </li>
          <li>
            The App is not designed to upload your raw audio or measurement history to our servers.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 Measurement History (Local Storage)</h3>
        <ul class="app-feature-list">
          <li>
            Calm dB may store a history of your measurement sessions (for example:
            average, minimum and maximum dB during a session, timestamps and optional
            names/labels you assign to sessions).
          </li>
          <li>
            This information is stored locally on your device in the App’s private storage
            and is not automatically uploaded to our servers.
          </li>
          <li>
            We do not have access to this local history and cannot retrieve it from your device.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.3 App Settings and Configuration</h3>
        <ul class="app-feature-list">
          <li>
            The App stores certain preferences (for example: theme, language, calibration
            offset, history options, screen-on behaviour) locally on your device so that
            the App can remember your choices between sessions.
          </li>
          <li>
            These settings are stored in the App’s private storage and are not sent to us.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.4 Personal Data</h3>
        <p>
          Calm dB does <strong>not</strong> require you to create an account, sign in, or provide
          your name, email address or other personal details in order to use the App.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not intentionally collect your measurement history or raw audio on our servers. However,
          the App uses Google Firebase for diagnostics (see section 7), which may process certain
          technical identifiers and crash/diagnostic information.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Exporting and Sharing the Measurements</h2>
        <p>
          The App includes features that let you <strong>export or share</strong> your measurement
          history (for example, as files such as CSV or JSON, or via the system share sheet).
        </p>
        <ul class="app-feature-list">
          <li>
            When you export or share measurements, the selected data is passed to the
            app or service you choose (for example, email, messaging, cloud storage).
          </li>
          <li>
            We do <strong>not</strong> receive a copy of this exported data. It is handled
            by the third-party apps or services you select, under their own privacy policies.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can always stop exporting or sharing and can delete the exported files
            or messages using the tools provided by those third-party services.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Permissions Used by the App</h2>
        <p>
          To function correctly, the App may request certain permissions from your device:
        </p>
        <ul class="app-feature-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Microphone</strong> – required to measure sound levels in real time.
            Without this permission the App cannot perform its core function.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The App uses the platform’s standard storage mechanisms for saving local data
          (app data inside the operating system sandbox) and does not request separate
          storage permissions to access your photos, media or files.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can manage permissions for Calm dB at any time in your device’s system settings.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Local Processing and Storage</h2>
        <ul class="app-feature-list">
          <li>
            All processing of microphone input for measurement is done directly on your device.
          </li>
          <li>
            Measurement history and settings are stored only in the App’s local storage
            on your device.
          </li>
          <li>
            We do not remotely store your measurements or settings on our own servers.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Third-Party Services and App Stores</h2>
        <p>
          The current version of Calm dB integrates with Google Firebase to improve app stability and fix bugs.
          Firebase may collect and process diagnostic information such as crash logs, operating system version,
          app version, and other technical data necessary for reliability and troubleshooting.
        </p>
        <ul class="app-feature-list">
          <li>
            Firebase is primarily used for crash reporting and diagnostics to identify and fix issues.
          </li>
          <li>
            Firebase is a third-party service operated by Google and is subject to its own privacy documentation and terms.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your measurement history and microphone readings are intended to remain on-device and are not designed to be uploaded to our servers.
            Crash reports may include limited diagnostic context (for example, app state, logs, and device information) to help reproduce and fix issues.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="muted">
          If a future version adds additional services (for example, ads or analytics),
          this Privacy Policy will be updated and the change will be clearly reflected here
          and in the app store listing. Where required by law, we will also ask for your
          consent inside the App.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that app stores and platform providers (such as Google Play and your
          device manufacturer) may collect their own usage data in accordance with their
          own privacy policies. We do not control their collection or use of such data.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Data Sharing and Legal Disclosures</h2>
        <ul class="app-feature-list">
          <li>We do not sell or rent your personal data.</li>
          <li>
            We do not share your measurement history or raw audio with third parties,
            as this data is not sent to us in the first place.
          </li>
          <li>
            We may disclose information only if required to do so by applicable law or
            in response to valid legal requests (for example, a court order). In normal operation,
            we do not hold your measurement history on our servers.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>
          Because the App does not store your measurement history on our servers, there is no
          server-side retention period for that data.
        </p>
        <p>On your device:</p>
        <ul class="app-feature-list">
          <li>
            Measurement history and settings remain on your device until you delete them
            or uninstall the App.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can remove this data by clearing the App’s data or uninstalling Calm dB
            via your device settings.
          </li>
          <li>
            Exported files or shares (for example, CSV/JSON you have sent by email or
            stored in cloud services) need to be deleted using those third-party services.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Calm dB is not specifically directed at children and does not knowingly collect
          personal data from children under the age of 13 (or other age defined by local law).
        </p>

        <h2>11. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data
          under local data protection laws (for example, the GDPR in the European Union / EEA
          or similar laws in other regions).
        </p>
        <p>
          While Calm dB is built to avoid collecting measurement data on our side, we still want
          to be transparent about your options:
        </p>
        <ul class="app-feature-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Access / information.</strong> You can contact us if you have questions
            about what data the App uses and how.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Correction / deletion.</strong> You can delete local data by clearing the
            App’s storage or uninstalling the App from your device.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Withdrawal of consent.</strong> You can revoke microphone permission at
            any time in your device settings. The App will no longer measure sound levels.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>12. International Users</h2>
        <p>
          The App may be used by users in different countries. Firebase (as a third-party provider)
          may process diagnostic data on infrastructure located in different regions. For details,
          please refer to Google Firebase documentation.
        </p>

        <h2>13. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, for example if we change how
          the App works or if we add new features such as analytics or advertising.
        </p>
        <ul class="app-feature-list">
          <li>
            When we make significant changes, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top
            of this page.
          </li>
          <li>
            Where appropriate, we may also provide an in-app notice or mention changes in the
            app store listing.
          </li>
        </ul>
