        <h2>Notes for measurement tools</h2>
        <p class="app-summary">
          Some Indie Apps Lab tools measure aspects of your environment, such as
          sound level. For these apps, please keep in mind:
        </p>
        <ul class="app-feature-list">
          <li>
            Readings may differ between devices because microphones and sensors
            are different and often tuned by the manufacturer.
          </li>
          <li>
            These apps are designed for indicative and educational use, not as
            certified professional measurement instruments.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="muted">
          If you rely on measurements for safety, regulation or professional
          work, please use certified equipment alongside our apps.
